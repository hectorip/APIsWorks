# API's Works

Designing an implementing API's, learning and testing best practices in
different languages (Elixir, Go, Python and PHP).

The resources I'm using to learn are three:

 - [Udacity's API's Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/designing-restful-apis--ud388)
 - [Build API's You Won't Hate by Phil Sturgeon](https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate)
 - [REST API Tutorial](http://www.restapitutorial.com/)
